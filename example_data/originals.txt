!,anyway when i left him i swore i,d never get married again!!
!he must be a control freak
'...does this mean he likes me?.
( even if he  is rich, dont sell ur self.
(It would be easier to do if I were mad, though!!
(and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
(i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
(saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...AND DON'T EVER GET WEAK!!)
(that's what i called it).. but , why?
(this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
)take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up
)women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
..... You tell her why you like her!
...a guy asks me, 'do you mind if we cuddle?
10 years gap is just nice.
20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT IS ALL YOU CAN BE SO START FROM THE BEGINNING
20 to 32...she doesn't have to be younger than you.
:) Although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
:) I haven't tried it yet, but I am still trying to get up the nerve....
;)  There is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
;) nah the only time u see a man emotional is when he is with his lady luv!
>>Other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
A couple of ways: -  Get him drunk.
A life of your OWN....a life you've been missing out on.
A picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated....thats special
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
After how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
After i while i t passes and i still love him
All in all I don't think it really matters.
Also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
Also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone.
Always trail ride with a friend.
And I hate him for it.
And I hear ya Fountain...same thing happened to me.
And I hope to God it doesn't ever pass!
And Im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless I really really like her.
And any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
And don't fall for the alcoholic only on weekends line that the guy above is giving.
And don't start with her looks, mister!
And hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years!
And if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - DONT.
And if you have, what was it like?
And remember there is more then 1!
And so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
And that will be just s*x!
And the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
And whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
And women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
And you don't have to be an overly happy hyper-active person.
Anything that is not nailed down!
Anyway my question is.... Will I always feel that way?
As a guy - let me say this.
As everyone said... dont get married so early.
Ask her out after class again.
Ask her questions (don't just talk).
Ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
Ask ur self that, if you know what I mean.
Ask your best friend if it'd be okay.
At least thats what it seems like to me.
B) Looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
BE CONFIDENT,ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.DO NOT BE ARROGANT THOUGH.ALWAYS MAKE GOOD EYE CONTACT.LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
BUT --  There's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
BUT IT IS OKAY TO KISS ON THE FIRST DATE.
Basically if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob / or slut then yes it is unattractive...
Bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
Be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps!
Be strong, and hang in there.
Be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
Beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
Because believe it or not, women hate cocky men.
Because he wouldn't work, hit me, used guilt trips, was a big mama's boy, etc.
Because if it fails you be up $h*T!
Because some couples NEVER get to that comfortable boring stage.
Because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly.
Because the white women are taking up all the men!!
Because womens don`t put out often...
Best of Luck  to you both :)
Brokeback Mountain ,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
But (there's always a but isn't there?
But I need to be happy.
But ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
But don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
But he chaeted, so i guess I can lift or carry my husband.
But he is getting married this month.
But he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming & teasing.
But he swears that we're just friends.
But if she doesn't have a reason then she isn't ur friend!
But it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
But some guys would do that...   WHY?
But stick with wats inside of u.
But those guys are jerks and you don't want them anwyay.
But try the nice way first..girls hate being ignored!
But you do what you want.
But you know what, I feel the guy should make the first move.
But you need to do this a few times.
But, I know exactly what I want in a relationship.
CONFRONT HIM AND ASK HIM THAT WAY YOU WILL KNOW
CUT YOUR COUSIN AN YOUR EX BOYFRIEND OFF COMPLETE.
Celebrate Valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
Chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
Coffee, lunch, site seeing, walk/talk/play in the park, museum, movie matinee
Confusing... yeah, i think your right.
Could it be because some men are liars and fat mouths??
DON'T LET HER RULE YOUR LIFE, SHE WILL JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH IT.
DON'T RUSH IT FEEL ALL YOUR EMOTIONS COME ALIVE.
DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
DONT LISTEN TO THESE FOOLS WITH AL THEIR B.S.
DROP HIS BUTTT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA OF AMORE:0)
Dang it, if only every man knew What Women Want the world would be a much happier place!!!
Death is like a big black bag full of of crack or smack or meth.
Death is like a box full of candy corn
Depends on the guy some guys do some don't
Depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
Depends, some days I want to have sex, somedays I don't.
Did  turn gay or is it a curiosity thing?
Did you ever think of that?
Do U love her in depth?
Do not try to have sex.
Do you know he loves you?
Do you like to argue and fight???
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
Don't be afraid to say no.
Don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
Don't do that, it won't work.
Don't do this over the phone, email, etc.
Don't eat where you take a s***.
Don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
Don't just stay with him for the baby.
Don't know, but daniel K has never read manga.
Don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
Don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
Don't persue it, he is getting married.
Don't think you should try it!
Don't use pick up lines , that's a turn off .
Don't worry what people will say.
Don't worry, I aint working with much either.
Dont tell them but let them find out once your in bed with her.
Dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
Dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
Dont you know the number one rule, Trust No One.
Downtown Houston just about any weekend... Lots of clubs...
Dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
Dude, you have to suck it up and introduce yourself.
Either way, best of luck but I'm just glad that I have brown hair!!
Either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
Especially if you don't feel like it.
Even the day after would be okay.
Everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
Everywhere.... Just ask any girl passing by.... but ONLY IN THAILAND....  not in US .... lol
Exchange letters, e-mails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages...  Just keep in touch!
FINALLY A CULTURE THAT HAS IT RIGHT.
FIRST YOU ORDER ONE ONLINE AND THE STORK BRINGS ONE TO YOU
First of all, why did u guys break up?
First off, I have 4 kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
For one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
For the guys: (A) Do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
Fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what I mean).
GIRLS DON'T THINK IT'S COOL, THEY THINK IT'S GUYS WHO SMOKE ARE PATHETIC COS THEY ARE KILLING THEMSELVES
GO TO HAWAII...HA HA HA OR ....PAY SOMEONE...LOL
GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES WELL!
Generally kind and my fifth: I'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
Get a life and don't waste mine.
Get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
Getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
Girl only you can decide on this...
Girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
Give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
Giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
Giving you stupid excuses of the wall!Acting the way he didn't before!
Go for it and take the chance!!!
Go out & do EVERYTHING you couldn't when you were with him/her!
Go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
Going to a club and dancing.
Good luck and keep it cool!
Good luck but DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
Good luck in your search for the one!
Gotta let the person you are with know what u want.
Guys come & go, but friends are forever!
HANG IN THERE FOR ONE THAT APPRECAITES YOU.
HELL YA I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THE LADYS!!
HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
Haha thats why I am single!
Haha...  Too bad it's not automatic like MSN or AOL.

How drunk is this girl getting?
How to make a woman happy  To make a woman happy....?
However that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
However, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between HAVING SEX and MAKING LOVE.
I ALWAYS FELT THE SAME WAY, BUT I MET MY TRUE LOVE AND MY VIEWS CHANGED!
I JUST GOT A  DIVORCE AND SO DO DID HE.
I LIKE THICK BECAUSE I FEEL CHEATED WITH A THIN ONE!
I LOVE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS TO  THE LADIES WITH POEMS,  HAS ANYBODY WRITTEN ONE FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE.
I actually ponder this one now and again.
I also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
I always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.
I am a guy and let me tell you, we love to chase!
I am man and I too feel so.... because I too am !!!
I am the maid of honor for my only sister and I want it to be perfect!
I asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
I can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........LOL
I can't see my life without my husband.
I cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
I dated a guy this past year and he got to the a violent point.
I dated one and I know.
I did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that I deleted him!
I do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible.
I do not know what to do because she knows how much I care about him.
I do....much prettier and smooth as silk!
I don't know about love,but he likes you for sure
I don't know can I do anything about it?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what you said because I was to lazy to read your typing.
I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
I don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
I don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
I don't need a trophy girl I want a companion.
I don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
I don't understand why people think it's wrong.
I don't want to be mean.
I dont ever remember giving a girl a Cristmas gift unless I liked her.
I dont know.But i know of another website that i go to..
I dont think I mind either way.
I dont think it is wise to date at work.
I even worked there for awhile and met the man of my dreams.
I feel bad because I know that I snore sometime -- most people do, right?
I feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
I find if I try real hard I can see things I know aren't there normally there.
I guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
I had someone get nasty with me because I was still dating?
I have a close girl friend.
I have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
I have no idea where to begin!!!
I have sexed many girls and some where whores.
I have yahoo email and that works for me.
I hope I see some of it soon.
I hope you find a NICE girl.
I just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby's father.
I know 3 guys that I can probably get away with doing something like that.
I know I have someone to come home to.
I know because I am just like your wife.
I know i'm overtly picky about people HOW CAN I STOP IT!
I know... Why should I hide it?
I like any guy that is funny.
I like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
I like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
I like natural / real girls, I don't like fake looking prissy drama queens.
I love curly hair I like to run my fingers thru it
I married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
I mean the both of you together.
I mean the worst -the absolute worst - is that she says no.TAKE A CHANCE & GOOD LUCK!
I must not be ugly enough then
I myself think that they do.
I never knew life could be so good!!!!
I never wanted to have sex again.
I never went out with him a second time.
I prefer A & B cups, myself.
I really care about you and I can't stop thinking about you.
I really like this guy, and I don't know if it's just a crush, or if I love him......
I still love him what to do
I think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
I think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
I think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
I told her that I loved her and truly meant it.
I told him it was too late...other than that, I wouldn't have minded getting flowers sometimes.
I totally agree with Udaman...good luck girl
I want my wife to GROW too.
I was NOT gonna let her win.
I was always looking and I kept picking jerks.
I will make u princess in planet Kripton !!
I will not stay with someone I don't trust.
I would be, but I'm just married !
I would not know... i have the same issue.
I would wonder why he shaved them but, in the end, they're his legs!
I wouldn't bother calling him back.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND FOR 4 YEARS WE RECENTLY GOT MARRIED IN DECEMBER OF 2005.
I'd perfer if they left me alone...  sorry, i got off-topic.
I'm confused I hate the girl to be like that ... what shall I do ?
I'm in love and don't care who knows it Buddy the Elf.
I'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
I'm ready to move on, but I love him way too much!
I'm still in love with my ex and I'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
I've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody.
IF YOU COULD HAVE 4 QUALITIES IN YOUR WOMAN, WHAT WOULD THEY BE.
IF YOU KEEP TALKING TO HIM FOR ANOTHER WEEK,HE MIGHT THINK HE IS MARRIED TO YOU.
IF YOU LIKE HIM THAT MUCH,CALL HIM.
IF he tUrNS YoU dOwN, HES NOT WORTH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
ILL BET YOUR NOT, BUT TRY TO EMAIL ME ATILIKETHICKCHIX@YAHOO.COM AND I WILL BE HONEST.
IS IT USUALLY ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE BOTH PEOPLE BEGIN 2 FEEL IN THAT COMFORTABLE,BORING, STAGE??
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE GIRL OR THE AND HOW INTERSTED THE GIRL IS IN THE GUY.
IT CAN BE GOOD LUCK ALSO IF YOU TAKE IT AS GOOD LUCK.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE SLUTTY.
IT JUST MEANS THAT SHE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE GUY.
IT'S YOUR CHOICE NOT TO  HATE ONE,  I DISLIKE THEM TO SAY THE LEAST.
IT'S YOUR OWN LIFE, AS YOU SAID.
ITS a man thing live with it EGO
I`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
If He Likes You, You'll Know!
If a guy cares he calls.
If all you do is argue it's not worth it..
If going to a movie is special for the 2 of you, then do that.
If he CAN'T then take him to a place where they have slowdances (dinner date, maybe?)
If he comes to his senses then great if not SCREW HIM!!
If he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
If he if flurting with her ok jump him .
If he is, then go for it!
If he isn't and you're still not ready, then screw him!
If not, then don't sweat it!
If shae like him then there is a reson .
If she is not into you anymore...
If she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
If she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
If she's interested she'll call later.
If the Guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
If they don't, it's time to move on.
If they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
If they have moved on then you should too.
If u guys still keep in touch---I dont think thats the best thing to do.
If yes, why do I heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
If you are gay BE GAY!!!
If you aren't happy fix it or get out.
If you do eat something like that then just quit.
If you do... then i would say it was a real and worth realtionship  :)    Good luck
If you don't you'll always wonder.
If you dont ask sombody else might.
If you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
If you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
If you guys TRUELY love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
If you have to ask, then you are not in love.
If you like the guy then go for it.
If you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
If you or the other person is married, RUN!!!!
If you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
If you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
If you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
If you truely love him you will tell him
If you truly love your man & want to work it out then tell your X to respect that.
If you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
If you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
If you want kids, then homemaker.
If you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
If you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
If you were friends before and have stronger feelings now then it should be O>K>
If youre asking this, u surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remaining a friend.
Im a gilr, i say those things....
Imagine that i am that guy and be MY girl freind!
Imgaine if it was JUST considered love??
Intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
Is there a reason that your not w/the baby's dad?
Is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes!!!
It always finds a way to get out in the open, just don't do it!
It could be  ( Choose one & why? )
It hurt like hell and I bled.
It is a mistake that can't be undone!
It is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
It just sounds like u wear the pants.
It really was a casual aside when I said it -- I didn't think he would remember.
It sounds like a con, but i'm telling you, chicks dig it.
It sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
It's a good idea to always be honest...besides not many guys I know don't like being told they're hot!
It's always in the back of my mind.
It's been over 6 months & I can't seem to get over it.
It's like breaking a drug habit.
It's like saying, What's got to stop me when I have already done it?
Its Shows how much they care about you!
JUST BE YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE WITH HER.
Jump him because she likes him??
Just Talk your spouse about this
Just be prepared cause if it happen once it can happen again!
Just be prepared to let her go.
Just do what makes you happy!
Just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about all this.
Just face him, say Hey I like you wanna see a movie?
Just find one that loves you too.
Just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
Just remeber,     s go for guys who are themselves and ONLY themselves!
Just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
Just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
Keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
King had a song about this - Only your Mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
LOL I think this is better than the one on top of me...
Least not till he gets another girlfriend.
Leave it alone-I don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
Let him go... either that or date his brother!
Lets get coffee and chat and take it from there!
Lets get it out of limbo ;)
Lie lie lie and then Lie some more
Like I said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
Listen to Faith Hill - Love Ain't like that            its a great example
Look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
Lust less like...you just go out?
MAKE A KIND MOVE , IF NO RESPONCE U KNOW WHAT TO DO !
Mabey because ou just think they look sexy when they are running on the feild
Mail me a pick honorarius@yahoo.com and I will tell you...
Man has penis and woman has clitoris.
Many people will tell you NO!
May be u think not but Yes!!!
Maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
Maybe he's going to call you!
Maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
Maybe you and I can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
Maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
Maybe your young, I don't know.
Me and this boy been going off and on since last year.
Me, I'll pick up the tab if, I can get your vote for best answer.
Men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't OBEY them!
Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
Men who were not ready to committ.
Most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
Move on - so what if he's hot...looks aren't everything.
Move on, but you can still luv him!!
My bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
My bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but I won't.
My boyfriend snores and I have the most terrible time sleeping!
My boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
My ex of 3 years cheated.
My friend says I am to nice and I should tell them no.
My girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
My girlfriend's the nuttiest, but I love her anyway.
My last girlfriend's Bf did that to her (before we met), and she still kept him.
My tragic love story was I loved him very much and he loved me too.
NEVER ever get married without a Prenup....
NO GOOD OR BAD IS YOUR PERSONAL BELIEF ON SOMETHING.
NO!NO!NO!IT CERTAINLY IS  MOST UNCOOL.U R SIMPLY WASTING UR HEALTH COS GIRLS JUST HATE IT.
Nay Pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
Needless to say, Im 36 now and STILL in therapy around it.
Never stop trying to impress her .
No (at least I hope not).
No brainer  Oh and nice picture of George Clooney on your profile LMAO
No matter what he says, Action speaks louder then words
No men don't but little boys do
No seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
No way im 5`4 and he`s 6`2
No, Not if you have to ask.
No, not if you have to ask...
No, you won't because you know he has cheating tendancies.
Nope, he's too darned big and I'm too darned weak!
Nope, she is not a liar.
Not all guys get bored and move on.
Not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years.
Not what you can become just because she says too.
Now I keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
Now me, I wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
OK IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOUR STARTING TO HAVE FEELINGS FOR THIS BOY!
OK, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
OTHERS LIKE THINK DUE TO SOCIETY DICTATES ITS; I SAY SCREW SOCIETY AND GIVE ME THICK!
Obviously she don't want you if you know she likes the other boy!
Obviously, men ain't much better ;-)
Of course HE wants to go on.
Of course after 3 day of that my back went out LOL.
Ofcourse, if she calls like 5 times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
Oh and some because theyre thin and skinny and nowadays anorexic girls are a turn on.
Oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
Oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
Ok Like I really really really like this guy and I dont know if he likes me back.
Ok, so I had this problem too.
Okay well first thing it sounds as if YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY MARRIED!.
One girl Michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she didn't believe in it.
One his side of his family I met his father.
Only I am not thinking about him but I am having dreams about him.
Only now she and I are both divorced.
Only the ones that aren't worth your time
Only time will tell spend time with friends have fun don't thimk sbout it
Or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
Or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
Or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
Overtime should I give him another chance?
PLEASE DONT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE !!
PRACTICE KISSING ME  WERE DO YOU LIVE?
PS Im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
Pay Attention to what the other person says!
People asked me - whats the hurry?
People don't like to be played yo-yo with.
Play sports with your guy friends.
Play the field a bit now.
Please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
Post more questions on Yahoo Answers!
Ppl whose parents well take care of them, big time lazy ppl.
Preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
Probably because I knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until I met my wife.
RELAX AND BE REAL THAT IS WHAT WE LIKE.
REMEMBER IT TAKES TWO NOT ONE
Red= love, black = death ect...
