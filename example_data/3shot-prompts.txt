That does not mean it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
That does not mean you should let them in.
That got me really hot, but I ran off.
That only makes her easier to bed.
That said, you need to figure out yourself if you want to stay married to him.
That way you don't have to worry about you calling him too much!
That way, you are not exactly telling them what you specifically do not like about them.
That's if you both agreed on doing this.
It was the right relationship.
That's why I do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless it's to
The best of luck to you!
The one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
The best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to Las Vegas and get married there.
The girls that whine that flowers do not last are just ungrateful.
The main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
The pictures I have seen... I would say Maui or the Bahamas.
The problem is not whether you ask her while at work or not.
The rest is easy from there!
The safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. chat via email and messenger 2. chat

The timing just wasn't right for it with the old guy... you'll see
Then comes the fun part... he making it up to you!
Then go pick them up( if she say yes).
Then he said do you want some of my chapstick?
Then if he still does not like you, then move on.

They are friends on the other hand, that's a different story.
There is nothing but trouble there.
There is no one you can trust more than a good friend.
They are always in the 'in love' stage.
They are often worse than men!
They bother you all day long.
They know the women will not chase them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of chic
They're a lot of fun- there's plenty to do.
Thing is, you do not have to ask her out to go out with her.
This gal does not want a bad boy at all.

To all my fellow girls at cone, a big hi and hug!
Truly she is not your friend, b-cuzz she wo not stop bugging
Trust him, do not bring it up again.
Try asking her out again and see what she says.
You should try not to hang out with him and find another guy.
Try to be yourself and do not show off.
Try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!
You can have a big u-no-what, n suck
Ugly( or fat) guys just take what they can get.
Uh- where have you been meeting these Filipinos?
Umm, small party for the family.
Wait for him to ask you out unless your real desprete

You have to stop talking to him and stop thinking about him.
Well, I believe everyone should keep their own name.
What you whant is a hooker, you can find that in any corner of the
Whatever you do... do not tell him too soon!
When will people in this effed up world finally realize this?!?!?!?!?!?!

Why do not you just leave the girl alone?
Wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go
Wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
Wanting to be something they're not?
We can not answer if she really means it.
We got married all over again!
We like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
We like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing.
We tried to move on but it did not work.
Well, I don't know how old you are, which would help.
Well, if you really like this guy, smile and make nice talk with him.
Well that is just the way it is.
Well, the one I liked goes like this.
Well, if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
What guy does not like big boobs?
What if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
What makes it worse is that I already went out with him for four years!
Whatever you decide, make it completly yours!
When I fall in love, I feel stupid.
When he teases you about the stupid little things.
When you first fall in love, you're gitty, goofy, and
I'm not sure.
What makes love like living a fantasy?
Whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
Why can not men( or boys in your case) ever say the word love?

You can share this with your mom or dad.
You catch her looking at you?
You go to a bar and get drunk!
You have to think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust
You guys do not have any reason to hate each other.

You know... if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do
You married him and it was for a reason.
You people have no right to get married!

Ask him to go see a doctor.
I can not understand you.
If you can afford it, do it.
Because you don't have any decision power what to do.

Bembie hit the nail on the head.
I think he has enough to worry about.
Both of you work hard to get it right!
By the way, your avatar looks familiar.
But I am not telling you to be celibate till then.
But cuddling up with a large woman is one of the best feelings I know of.
But he was a little busy after that.
But I don't think by not having sex with him he will become un

Choose the one that adores you the most!
Come to my town, I'll be your girl.
You should compliment her... ask her name... act like you are the smoothest guy
Compliments, honesty and make it about her.
Could it ever be the same?
Because they are girls and they are not as sophisticated as we are!
Cuddling, kissing, fondling, playing with each other's sex organ
Curves, especially if they have big boobs, and softness
Because they like the little titis and pussys
Depending on the age, CDs or DVDs.
Depending on what you are looking for, friendship only, like.
Depending on what you kissed.
Depends on how old they are.
Depends on if they are brunette or not.
I guess it depends on the girl, but fair skinned females look extra pale
I'm sorry, but I have to be careful.
Do not tell everyone just because you think that's right.
I want to be in love.
Do it before it is too late
I do.
I'm sure he'll do what's best for you and him.
I'm not sure.
Do you like manicured nails or fake ones?
Yes, I mean to seem more sexy.
Is she going to call me back?
Do not ask her to perform some act for you, make her the spotlight.
Don't do things that can hurt you.
Don't even listen to what people, not just guys say, watch how they act.
Dump him... there are always more fish in the sea.
You are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from.
I think that's the case with most people these days.
Figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
Find a girl who has talets, she also must be prety.
If that does not work, you can move back.
Find someone you like and say will you be my valentine!
Flirt and see how he responds
Focus on how things are and what would be best for you right now.
Follow your heart... it's neva wrong
For me anything after three days and I might start to forget about you.
For the same reason, thin girls prefer slender tonned guys.
Gals love guys with positive self image.
Get a grip, how can you love someone that you do not even communicate with.
Get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
Girl, there are more guys out there that love thick girls than you think?
Girls are just as perverted-trust me.
Girls are perverts, they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly
Girls are simply impressed if you can show a little care, respect and honesty to them
Give a rose and express your love.
Give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be
Give it some time and thought.
They will get over you in two months.

Go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you.
You can find it in the deleted items section.
Go up to her and say, 'Hi, are you single?'
I'm only 18 years old.
Thank you for your support.
Guys are stupid! who knows why they do what they do.
Guys have a problem with secrets.
Guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
Guys will think you're hot no matter what with this usually.

No, I'm talking about my avatar.
I think it's better to sit there and wait until you are a good one.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Say I love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all.
He is willing to go out of his way for you.
She calls him all the time.
You can shop around for invitations and everything else!
I think you should make the first move.
Should I or should not I. younger guy vs older woman
Show her your naked baby pictures.
Simple enough, do like anyone else does..... play with it.
Simple... honesty and love and try to true with them
Size, shape, looks, etc. should not matter at all.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how to proceed.
Smaller of course, and it is all about looks!
I hope this helps.
So in my opinion, you are not a hoe.
He lost a good thing.
I had to ask him if he was blowing me off.
Yes, it looks very nice on most girls.
So there are some guys that only say the L word if they mean it.
So wait for another four years.
You might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you.
So, no I feel it's a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them
Some of them do, but I would rather have a pair that were not too big.
Someone I can be myself with.
Sometimes, but you have to observe the one you call your man.
Sometimes it's better to be very good friends first and make sure your happy around each other
Sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the good outweighs the bad
Sounds like you really love her... no need to forget her!
Start the day off with breakfast out... then perhaps a nice walk.
Start with a basic everyday question and go from there:)
Stay alive and get your old life back.
Stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact.
Sure, let me know more about you.
Sure... and will you pay mine too?
Sweetheart, let him go, if he is ment to be with you
Do you know how to speak English?
Take it off pop up block
They are going to take you out to dinner.
Tell her to move to mass.
Tell him that you are a wannabe friend and that you are relly disappointed that
I'm not sure what you mean by that.
Tell him, and it would not seem psycho because you have known each other for a long
Tell more people (my boss did)
That is a sign, things like that can make it really obvious.
That way you can still go by your last name!
That would be so painful, trust me, been there done that!
That's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it
That's too many, and selfish, indeed.... you just desperate n keep on
That's a chance you gon na have to take.
That's a stereotype( not a country girl by the way) and I think
That's all I have to say.
That's weird, but maybe I'll talk to my friend by his locker.
That's why they call it making love.
The doctor can not even believe it.
I think that he is a very self centered person.
The girlz that are pretty or have a great personality.
The guy I like is mad at me.
The list could go on and on.
The people who are around you now, like your friends, should like you no matter what!
The right date can save money on lots of things.
The thing is, I am a person that does not like to break others hearts.
The two of you should talk privately and personally... you have to clear each other's
If he's impressed or likes you, he'll talk back.
Then she might say that looks ugly I think ( a color) looks better.
Then you can make an easier decision.
There are a lot of good women left, just have to look in the right place.
There are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
There are movies that I have not seen yet.
There are no words that are going to make it any better.
There are some that do, but you should be able to contact them.
There is no right or wrong way to kiss anyone.
He got off the train.
They accept this in thier culture.
They do not mean to get them pregnant, they just can not keep it in there pants because
They feel that they are better than womens but they are wrong.
They have never performed before and it doubles the pleasure!
They like the challenge. I know that's what I love about it.
They never met, but she says they're in love.
They probably know you can't really hide that, but you should tell your parents.
They think it is the only right way!
They think that they can control other people's lives when thye can't
Think about what good it brought about.
This is a big day in both of your lives, it shouldn't be done quickly
This is a sin, our selves have started this
Though I am 19, I like anything up to 30?
Time will tell, give it six months and see what happens.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you get through this.
You are asking if I like you.
You just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
You need to be with that person, you have found your true love.
You need to reput it in and add it back just like first time.
You seem desperate and you'll never find a job if you're desperate.
You should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them
You sound like a very lovely person, so don't let some of these gals
You'll find a man who really deserves you one day.
You'll see that no matter how hurt you are, it's still the simplest
I think anyone does.
Except it's with the wrong man.
Unless you don't love your husband anymore and you have room for another man?
Your self image is also very important.
I think it is multiple things, not just one thing.
Wait a little while then date guys that way you enjoy it more.
Wait till you get 25. you would not loose your charm by then.
Want to get something you can not get rid of, go ahead then
We always seem to push the ones we love away.
We can restle around and be the best of friends.
We don't know what you look like.
We fall in love, they treat us bad, why are we there?
We were hangin out a lil.
We will not regret it.at your service anytime.
We've tried breakin up a couple times but it never happens.
Well, after you take her out, get to know her some and then go four the kill

I'll depend on women what she wants.
Well from your list, I would have to choose spiderman.
I hope you read this really well.
Well, I met mine in a carnival.
Well, if he says he isn't going to believe him, I
Well, if it was before you then he wasn't cheating at all
Well, if they gave you their phone number, you don't have to wait at
Well, just go up to her.
Well to tell you tha truth, you learn but you have to actually do it.
Well, if you can imagine your self with him in bed@ night!
I think that's why they are so good at what they do.
Well, you, and that sexy perfume you wear!
Well, I'm a girl so I can help you out.
The politician took Viagra and he was able to stop his bleeding.
What should I do to get her?
What special gift can I give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
What the hell are you talking about?
I made a mistake.
What's the worst that could happen?
When he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him
When my sister kisses someone, she closes her eyes to get ready.
When one minute you want to throttle the other person& the next you want to jump their bones
When possible, try to make it yourself.
When she calls, text her back.
When you are 18, or 20, because when they said something they don't mean it
When you can fart in front of the one your dating
Who cares what anyone else thinks?
Who knows, but I would absouletly love that two be done to me.
Who said women don't feel anything?
Why do gays want to get married?
They want it state sanctioned because it is a crime.
Why does it matter what they think if they don't get along don't spend
Why do not you try chatting/seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
Why don't you just ask her if you can kiss her?
I'll do it now.
The wife because then you can do more with out comminting a sin.
With her taking your number, there's nothing wrong wit that.
Without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
Women don't want much, just some acknowldgement and sometimes help
Women take on alot and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
Wow, go with the one that picks on you because nine times out of ten
Yah, look me up if you are ever in Florida laughing out loud!

You are too good for them.
You can do a civilian arrest.
You can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat.
You care your family and everybody in your family will love you.
You did not give us very good information/ do you all live in one house.
You don't look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a girlfriend
You don't want anyone else but that person ever
You give at least five minutes for kissing and hugging and may be some licking
You have to find what's right for you and your partner/s!
You have to search yourself for this one.
You just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
You like him or you do not like him?
You married your husband hopefully because you love him.
You need a therapist for that.
You never know, gurl, they never show efection only when they want something
You should be proud of yourself.
You should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
You should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
You should probaly make a move because he is obviously shy.
You should not be asking this question?
You sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly
You still released at least a thousand!
You want all your friends forever?)
You win some you lose some, take it with a grain of salt and be more careful
You would be genuinly surprised in the type of people that go to them.
You're probably just too good for him anyway.
